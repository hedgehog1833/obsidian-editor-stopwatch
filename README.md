# Obsidian Timetracker plugin

This plugin adds a stopwatch to track time of something. Per hotkey the current value of the stopwatch can be inserted into the editor, to make notes to 
this precise moment in time.
The stopwatch functionality is a completely rewritten clone of https://github.com/tokuhirom/obsidian-stopwatch-plugin
